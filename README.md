# Hanafuda: The Japanese Flower Card Game

Welcome to my project, a digital rendition of the traditional Japanese Flower Card Game, Hanafuda, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). This project was initiated with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the Game

Hanafuda, also known as Koi-Koi, is a classic Japanese card game that uses a deck of 48 cards divided into 12 suits, each representing a month and a specific flower. The game involves creating specific card combinations, known as "yaku", to earn points. A yaku can range from two to ten cards, each with a certain point value. The game ends when a player's score totals 50 points. For a detailed understanding of the scoring system, refer to these resources:
